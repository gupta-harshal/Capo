# CAPO – AI Productivity & Thought Management Platform

CAPO is an AI-powered productivity and thought management platform designed to help individuals capture ideas, manage tasks, and organize their mental workflow — effortlessly.

In today’s fast-paced environment, people constantly generate thoughts, ideas, to-dos, and reminders. CAPO acts as a **second brain**, allowing users to record voice notes, extract actionable tasks, and automatically organize everything using Artificial Intelligence.

The platform eliminates the need for manual structuring, helping users focus more on execution and less on organization.
